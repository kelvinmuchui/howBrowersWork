# How browsers Work
A browser has a UI (user interface) that most commonly includes.
..*address bar 
..*back/forward button 
..*reload button

...When you navigate to a URL in the address bar you are making a request for the content at that URL.

...The URL typed on the address bar it maps to an IP address which is called Domain Name System lookup. One can type in the IP address and navigate to the page you want

...HTTP stands for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol” and is used to facilitate requests from the browser and responses from the server.

...As this HTML response is being sent to your browser, the browser’s rendering engine is displaying the requested content on your screen.

...The browser then parses style data and together with the HTML it constructs a render tree.

...Then the browser lays out the contents in the position they will appear in the browser. 

...The last step is “painting” where the elements are drawn on the screen.

 ...As the browser is rendering it send a request to the web server to get each of these files required by the user.
